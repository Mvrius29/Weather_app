# Weather App 🌦️

Hello, this is my first app. At this moment i only structured the based modules and I realised the UI interface. On the next steps I will uprgade the app to work for real dates, 
that will be get from an api. This is just the begining , I will come with updates.

Now works:
1. UI:
```bash
-> showLoading
-> hideLogin
-> showError
-> hideErro
-> displayWeather
```
3. Weather-Service:
```bash
-> getCurentWeather
-> getWeatherByCoord
```
5. App :
```bash
-> handleSearch
-> setupEventListeners
```
## 🛠️ Tech Stack
```bash
-Html
-Css
-JavaScript
```
## 📦 Instalation

To use this app , in this moment you just need to download the archives with all files that are on this repository.
After, you wil anarchive the folders in one folder to can open it with the visual stuido code. To open the app, you need to have instal on vs code the " live server"
extension. In final, to open  the app, you need to open the index.html with live server.

For the moment the app isn't launched to can be find on internet, in future that will change.
